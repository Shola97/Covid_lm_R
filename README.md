# Covid_lm_R
Linear regression model and variance comparison with COVID data

This was a summative master's project. Using R studio I was to utilise Covid data from WHO, which showed Covid deaths per 100,000 in a group of countries compared with data on Covid vaccine rates.

I was given the following tasks:
Task 1: Apply a regression model

1. Apply a regression model to establish the effect between "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" and "Total vaccine doses administered per 100 population" of European Union countries.

2. Make a scatter dot plot graph representing the linear regression between the two sets of data "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" and "Total vaccine doses administered per 100 population". ![image](https://github.com/Shola97/Covid_lm_R/assets/107686145/368065d2-420c-4d2e-b57c-57c9e520ea9a)


3. Briefly discuss the results obtained by the regression model.

Task 2: Compare variances

1. Divide "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" into two groups:
Low vaccination rate: Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Czechia, Greece.
High vaccination rate: Cyprus, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, France, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Portugal. 

2. Calculate the Mean and Standard Deviation of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" for each group.

3. Do a bar graph (one bar per group) representing the Mean with a Standard Deviation of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" of each group. ![image](https://github.com/Shola97/Covid_lm_R/assets/107686145/dc2b7e2e-e02e-4f68-9ede-202d913d1e4e)


4. Perform ANOVA of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" between groups.

5. Briefly discuss the results obtained.
