Linear regression model and variance comparison with Covid data

This was a summative masters project. Using R studio I was to utilise Covid data from WHO , which showed Covid deaths per 100,000 in a group of countries compared with data of Covid vaccine rates.

I was given the following tasks:
Task 1: Apply a regression model

1. Apply a regression model to establish the effect between "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" and "Total vaccine doses administered per 100 population" of European Union countries.

2. Make a scatter dot plot graph representing the linear regression between the two sets of data "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" and "Total vaccine doses administered per 100 population".

3. Briefly discuss the results obtained by the regression model.

Task 2: Compare variances

1. Divide "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" in two groups:
Low vaccination rate: Bulgaria, Romania, Slovakia, Croatia, Slovenia, Latvia, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Hungary, Czechia, Greece.
High vaccination rate: Cyprus, Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain, Austria, Sweden, Germany, Denmark, France, Finland, Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Portugal. 

2. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" for each group.

3. Do a bar graph (one bar per group) representing the Mean with Standard Deviation of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" of each group.

4. Perform ANOVA of "Deaths - cumulative total per 100,000 population" between groups.

5. Briefly discuss the results obtained.
